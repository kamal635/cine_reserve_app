## üßë‚Äçüíª Development Approach

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  - Data, domain, and presentation layers are strictly separated (Clean Architecture).
- **Bloc Pattern:**  
  - All business logic and state transitions are handled via Bloc for maintainability and testability.
- **Dependency Injection:**  
  - All dependencies are registered and managed via GetIt for easy scalability.
- **Constants & Theming:**  
  - All colors, gradients, and strings are centralized for easy customization.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Custom error states and offline screens for robust UX.
- **Image Handling:**  
  - All movie images are loaded from TMDB using the correct base URL, with fallbacks for missing images.
- **Responsive UI:**  
  - Uses `flutter_screenutil` for pixel-perfect layouts on all devices.

---

## üìù Notes

- All Bloc event/state definitions are in separate files for clarity.
- All text strings are extracted as constants for easy localization.
- The app is fully commented in English for maintainability.
- The project is ready for further extension (e.g., user authentication, payment integration).
